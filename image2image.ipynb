    "# Search Similar Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an example image can we find similar images without the need of any labels? Leveraging Jina, we have the advantage that \n",
    "we don't need to use any labels or textual information about the images in order to build a search for similar images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to create an image search system that retrieves similar images. We are going to\n",
    "use the test split of the [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data?select=test1.zip) dataset, which we\n",
    "will subsequently refer to as the pets dataset. It contains 12.5K images of cats and dogs. Now, we can define our\n",
    "problem as selecting an image of cat or dog, and getting back images of similar cats or dogs respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jina searches semantically, and the results will vary depending on the neural network that we use for image encoding. Our\n",
    "task is to search for similar images so we will consider visually-similar images as semantically-related.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build the Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution uses a simple pipeline that can be subdivided into two steps:  **Index** and **Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index\n",
    "\n",
    "To search something out of the full dataset, we first need to index the data. This means that we store the embeddings\n",
    "of all the images from the dataset in some form of storage. The images can be read as a numpy array which is then\n",
    "fed to the neural network of our choice. This neural network encodes the input images into some latent space which we call\n",
    "\"embeddings\". We then use an **Indexer** to store these embeddings in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is indexed, i.e. our database is built, we simply need to feed our query (an image or set of\n",
    "images) to the model to encode it into embeddings and then use the **Indexer** to retrieve matching images. The matching\n",
    "can be based on any type of metric but without going deeper into this, we will focus only on Euclidean distance between\n",
    "two embeddings (corresponding to two images).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **SimpleIndexer** Executor as\n",
    "our indexer (the one that stores and retrieves data). This Executor also returns the matching `Document` when we make\n",
    "a query. The search part is done using the built-in `match` function of `DocumentArray`. To encode the images into\n",
    "embeddings we will use our own Executor which uses the pre-trained 'ResNet101' model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to wrap the image data as `Document`s and form a `DocumentArray`. This can be done easily with the\n",
    "following code snippet. `from_files` creates an iterator over a list of image paths and yields `Document`s:"
